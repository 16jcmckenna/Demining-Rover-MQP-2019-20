### Abstract
The use of PNM-1 anti-personnel landmines, along with poor documentation and scale of their deployment, has led to a humanitarian crisis. Current methods of landmine removal, including military-grade equipment, trained animals, and manual deminers, are dangerous, ineffective, and expensive. Our project will develop a cost-effective autonomous robotic solution to the world's landmine crisis by utilizing a rover and drone working in tandem. An easy-to-use application will combine these systems and make the solution accessible to non-technical users.
